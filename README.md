 Client: A leading Construction Industry in Malaysia
 
 Business Problem:
 The construction industry facing challenges in maximizing labor performance due to various factors like 
 lack of real-time data on worker performance, inefficient scheduling, and inadequate optimization 
 methods. This results in reduced productivity, increased costs, and lower project quality, impacting 
 customer satisfaction and profitability.
 
 Business Solution:
 Developed a Labor Workforce Efficiency & Performance Analytics system using ML/IoT, randomforest  
 classifier, and Streamlit. Real-time data on worker performance helps optimize schedules and identify 
 inefficiencies, leading to increased productivity and reduced costs. Improving labor performance can 
 enhance project quality, customer satisfaction, and overall profitability in the construction industry.
